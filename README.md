# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description

I was given the task of building a quiz webpage to test the user's JavaScript knowledge. The expectations were to have a multiiple choice quiz with a timer that decreases with each incorrect answer selected. When the quiz is finished, an option is to be given to save the user's initials and score.
